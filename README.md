# strstrbench

This is a stupid project to measure the performance of some string search
algos.

The results are available in `results/`. The main entrypoint is the
`benchmarker.py` script which will compile and evaluate `src/strstrbench.c`.

Messy project but the results are accurate.

Ran on P2 thinkpad.
